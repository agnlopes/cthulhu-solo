    Sister Beth knows not what God's plan for ther may be, except that
    she'll likely meet him very soon. Afflicted at an early age with a
    nervous nature, young Beth made the rounds through various hospitals
    and sanitariums before finding peace (and fatalism) in church. Were
    it not for the insulation her faith provides her psyche, she would
    have survived her first encounter with the Old Ones and their cults.
    Since then, she's become an expert on the occult and their horrific
    practices, justified in the beliefe that the day she finally falls
    will be the day of her ultimate salvation.
