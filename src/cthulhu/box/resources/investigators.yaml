- name: Adam
  long_name: Lord Adam Benchley
  origin: Manchester, England
  quote: Shoot first. Never ask.
  skills: [Fueled by Madness, Marksman, Thoughness]
  description: "Lord Benchley's signature eye-twitch is both word and warning
    of the roiling thoughts beneath his calm, British Demeanor. the
    man holds hilself together admirably, but most invetigators know
    to keep some reserve around the poor fellow, lest the twitch
    settle into a steely glare. Lord Benchley is quite mad of course,
    having battled the cults for decades and always maintaing the upper
    hand, if only barely. Lord Benchley himself relies on a stiff upper
    lip, stoic resolve, and indulging his psychotic tendencies against
    cultists and their foul minions at the very opportunity."

- name: Beth
  long_name: Sister Beth
  origin: Bogot√°, Colombia
  quote: Their lack of faith should disturb them.
  skills: [High Strugh, Brawling, Thoughness]
  description:
    "Sister Beth knows not what God's plan for ther may be, except that
    she'll likely meet him very soon. Afflicted at an early age with a
    nervous nature, young Beth made the rounds through various hospitals
    and sanitariums before finding peace (and fatalism) in church. Were
    it not for the insulation her faith provides her psyche, she would
    have survived her first encounter with the Old Ones and their cults.
    Since then, she's become an expert on the occult and their horrific
    practices, justified in the beliefe that the day she finally falls
    will be the day of her ultimate salvation."

- name: Fatima
  long_name: Fatima Safar
  origin: Alexandria, Egypt
  quote: Admittedly, Old One names are easier to read than say
  description:
    "While anyone with a working knowledge of the occult may read simple
    signs in the bones, stars, or Tarot, these are but children's books
    for Fatima Safar. her ability to connect dozens of minior phenomena
    into accurate prophecy is unparalleled in modern times. the future
    is not set until it becomes the past, and for an investigator of
    Fatima's skill, even a few minutes of warning can divert events alway
    from potential catastrophe, wheter that be through preparing a paper
    trap or simply running the other way as fast as she can."

- name: Elizabeth
  long_name: Elizabeth Ives
  origin: London, England
  quote: Heads! I win again. Best six out of eleven, luv?
  skills: [Lucky, Marksman, Stealth]
  description:
    "The saying that luck is better than skill rarely proves true, until
    one meets Elizabeth Ives. There's no magic surround her, no blessing
    from the stars, and certainly no taint of the Old Ones. She is simply
    frankly, supremely lucky. She has no idea how she does it, but three
    investigators can search a room for hours and find nothing whereas
    she'll walk in and step right on the button for the secret door. for
    it all, she's glad of the talent, but secretly dreads the day her lucky
    runs out."

- name: Ahmed
  long_name: Ahmed Yasin
  quote: What is written is written
  skills: [Healing Prayer, Stealth, Arcane Mastery]
  description:
    "While Ahmed's medical qualifications might not earn him any formal degrees
    investigators can rely on his unshakable calm, steady hands, and vast Arcane
    knowledge to stitch cuts, soothe burns, and reattach severed limbs. Ahmed's
    fascination with ancient occult healing led where most arcanes studies do,
    bringing him in contact with the various cults. He even joined a few in hilself
    time, the better to learn their ways and destroy them from within. All magic
    comes with a cost to the soul, yeat he pays it gladly, viewing his sacrifice
    with both faith and fatalism."

- name: Morgan
  long_name: John Morgan
  origin: Fort Wayne, Indiana
  quote: I've got a bad feeling about this...
  skills: [Protector, Swiftness, Thoughness]
  description:
    "John Morgan was a professional animal handler and safari master who had them
    misfortune of being hired to lead a cult expedition into the heart of the Congo.
    He had no idea who these weirdos were with their strange tatoos and ways, but
    he brought them to the ruin they wought, then pulled that ruin down on their
    heads when he found out what they were up to. Since then, he's done his Best
    to battle their kind across the globe, helping fellow investigators in their
    secret war to end all wars."

- name: Ian
  long_name: Sergeant Ian Welles
  origin: Jonesboro, Maine
  quote: They have us surrounded, those poor bastards
  skills: [Vengeance Obsession, Brwaling, Swiftness]
  description:
    "Sergeant Welles has many stories about his missing arm. For his brothers-in-arms
    in the Great War, it was a German artillery shell. For civilians, it was a sniper.
    But for fellow investigators, he need spin no tall tales: it was 'some God-damned
    cult-borne hell beastie what swallowed my hand, grenade and all.' Sergeant Welles
    is a master of giving back twice as much as he gets. Pain sharpens his aim, he says,
    and if the scars and burns that cross his body are any indicator, his aim is
    perfectly lethal."

- name: Rasputin
  long_name: Rasputin
  origin: Moscow, Russia
  quote: Sigh... Dead again
  skills: [Unkillable, Arcane Mastery, Brawling]
  description:
    "Living forever wasn't exactly Rasputin's idea. He was captured by a cult after
    destroying one of their most extensive operations. Their particular brand of
    torture involved 'gifting' him with a cycle of instant revivification, such that
    he could be tortured to death again and again. Naturally, this didn't go the way
    the cult planned. He escaped, killing their leaders in the process, and discovered
    the 'gifg' had stuck with him. The magic itself is slowly decaying, and he knows
    that eventually he will die one final time, but for now, he intends to use this
    power for the greater good."

- name: Borden
  long_name: Borden
  origin: Fall River, Massachusetts
  quote: "Two things are certain in life: Death and Axes"
  skills: [Savage, Swiftness, Stealth]
  description:
    "Ms. Borden loves killing. Murder, to be precise. The guilty must be punished for their
    horrors they inflict on the innocent, and these cultists and their horrific allies would
    consume the world for their own selfish ends. Ms. borden sees herself as the perfect
    weapon in this fight. Even ordinary investigators suffer ill psychological effects from
    the death they must visit on their foes. Not Ms. Borden. In fact, she considers 'sorting out'
    the guilty a soothing exercise. Hers is a disturbing form of psychopathy, but one that suits
    her self-appointed role fo executioner perfectly."

- name: The Kid
  long_name: The Kid
  origin: Unknown
  quote: "HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA!!!"
  description:
    "Except for a gleeful cackle, The Kid, as she has become known, makes no other sound. She's
    something of a mystery to investigators, and her knowing gaze and thousand-yard stare speak
    to a potential age far beyound her diminutive stature. She has no apparent need of guardians
    or guidance in her one-child campaign against the cults and their otherwordly allies. She
    shows a special affinity for interdimentinoal gateways, gaining obvious strenght and acume from
    the proximity. This could hint ag a supernatural origin for The Kid, but her glee in destroying
    said gates and the beings they summon speakes to no allegiance."
