    description: "Lord Benchley's signature eye-twitch is both word and warning
                  of the roiling thoughts beneath his calm, British Demeanor. the
                  man holds hilself together admirably, but most invetigators know 
                  to keep some reserve around the poor fellow, lest the twitch
                  settle into a steely glare. Lord Benchley is quite mad of course,
                  having battled the cults for decades and always maintaing the upper
                  hand, if only barely. Lord Benchley himself relies on a stiff upper
                  lip, stoic resolve, and indulging his psychotic tendencies against
                  cultists and their foul minions at the very opportunity."

  - name: Beth
    long_name: Sister Beth
    origin: Bogot√°, Colombia
    quote: Their lack of faith should disturb them.
    description: "Sister Beth knows not what God's plan for ther may be, except that
                  she'll likely meet him very soon. Afflicted at an early age with a
                  nervous nature, young Beth made the rounds through various hospitals
                  and sanitariums before finding peace (and fatalism) in church. Were
                  it not for the insulation her faith provides her psyche, she would
                  have survived her first encounter with the Old Ones and their cults.
                  Since then, she's become an expert on the occult and their horrific
                  practices, justified in the beliefe that the day she finally falls
                  will be the day of her ultimate salvation."
