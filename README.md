# Cthulhu Solo

This is a simple TUI (Text User Interface) for the Cthulhu Death May die game,
by Mythos. It is intended to be played solo, with multiple investigators if
wanted. The game is played in a terminal, and is written in Python.

The reasoning behind coding this tui is to have an easy and quick way to play
the game without having to set up the board. Specially when you want to try a
different strategy but don't wanna go through the hassle of setting up board
over and over again.
